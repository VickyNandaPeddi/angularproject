  1.Cryocan- Liquid Nitrogen Dewars( 0.5 Ltr to 55 Ltr)

  Cryocan is a double walled non-pressurised Aluminium container used for storing Liquid Nitrogen. Cryocans are mainly
  used to preserve bull semen under extreme cold temperatures i.e @ -196 Deg C in liquid Nitrogen. The bull semen thus
  preserved is used for artificial insemination in the field to get a better breed of cows for higher milk yield.
  Cryocans are also used for various other applications embryos & stem cells preservation,IVF clinics ,Dermatology and
  shrink fitting etc. Being a signature product of BG(Cryo) holding a majority market share in the country , these are
  also exported to Europe ,Singapore, Sri Lanka, Bangaladesh, etc. Cryocans are built to renowned IS:11552 standards.

  Bulk Storage Cryogenic containers are manufactured with Stainless steel to preserve large doses of semen in semen
  storage and collection centers.

  Manufacturing facility has a installed capacity to produce around 25000 Cryocans per year.

  2.Cryovessels- Pressurised Large Capacity Cryogenic containers


  Cryovessels are also double walled vessels with inner vessel made of Stainless Steel and outer vessel made of carbon
  steel. These are used for storage and transportation of Liquefied gases like Liquid Nitrogen (LIN), Liquid Oxygen
  (LOX) , Liquid Argon (LAr) and Liquified Natural gas(LNG). Developed with initial technical knowhow from Wessignton
  Cryogenics. UK, BG(Cryo) built on to much higher capacities using in house expertise.
  Cryovessels are designed and manufactured confirming to various internationsl codes Viz.ASME,EN,ADM,BS,&ISO under
  reputed Third Party Inspection agencies like LRA, BV, TUV, PDIL etc to meet rough Indian conditions.
